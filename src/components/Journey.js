            <p>
              I began my coding journey about a year ago, during my first year at college. At first, I didnâ€™t know much about coding, and I was filled with curiosity and excitement. Coding felt like an entirely new world, and I was eager to dive in and explore.

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Learning My First Programming Language</h3>
            <p>
              My first programming language was <strong>Java</strong>, which I started learning in college. Initially, it was challenging, but over time, I started to grasp the concepts and got comfortable with the syntax and structure. Java became the foundation of my coding knowledge.

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Exploring Data Structures and Algorithms</h3>
            <p>
              As I gained confidence with Java, I started exploring <strong>Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)</strong>. This was the turning point in my journey, as I realized how crucial problem-solving skills are in coding. I began solving problems on platforms like <strong>GeeksForGeeks</strong> and <strong>LeetCode</strong> to sharpen my DSA skills.

            <p>
              With a basic understanding of Java and DSA, I started participating in coding contests on platforms like <strong>CodeChef</strong> and <strong>LeetCode</strong>. These contests challenged me to think quickly and solve problems efficiently. The excitement of competing and improving my ranking kept me motivated.

            <p>
              My journey in full-stack development began in my second year. I started by learning the basics of <strong>HTML, CSS,</strong> and <strong>JavaScript</strong>. This gave me a strong foundation in frontend development, and I became comfortable building static web pages.

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Exploring Frontend Frameworks</h3>
            <p>
              As I progressed, I explored modern frontend frameworks like <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong> and <strong>Bootstrap</strong>, which helped streamline my UI development. I also learned <strong>React</strong>, which became my go-to frontend framework for building interactive and dynamic web applications.

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Learning Backend Development</h3>
            <p>
              After mastering the frontend, I delved into backend development. I learned <strong>Node.js</strong> and <strong>Express</strong>, which allowed me to create powerful and scalable server-side applications. I also worked with databases like <strong>MongoDB</strong> and <strong>MySQL</strong> to manage and store data effectively.

            <p>
              During this phase, I developed two full-stack applications:
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
                <li><strong>Hisab</strong>: A personal finance management app that allows users to track their income, expenses, and savings.</li>
                <li><strong>Shopping App</strong>: An e-commerce platform with product listings, shopping cart functionality, and secure payment options.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Advancing in Third Year</h3>
            <p>
              In my third year, I expanded my skills further by learning <strong>React Native</strong> to build cross-platform mobile applications. I also focused on adding advanced features like <strong>authentication</strong>, integrating third-party APIs, and enhancing the security of my applications.
